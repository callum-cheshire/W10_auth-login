# Auth Hackathon

Your challenge is to ideate, plan, and build a React app that uses authentication via Auth0. What you build is up to you, but it should include functionality for users to log in and out and a way to show and use user profile information.

Start simple, get your app working (including logging in and out and showing the user's info when logged in) as your first priority, and then iterate! What else can you do now that you have the power of auth in your hands? Your main aims for today are to embed what you learned in the tutorial in your own app and to continue exploring the Auth0 docs and features.

Along with the tutorial you used during the workshop, you can also view the full Auth0 docs [here](https://auth0.com/docs/articles). One of the benefits of using a widely-used tool like Auth0 is that there are plenty of other videos and articles out there, so if something isn't quite clicking, search on Google until you find an explanation that makes sense to you.
